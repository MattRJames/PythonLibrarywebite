 <p> The first books to be recognised were found in Egypt and can be dated to the 2400BC,
    since then written literature has taken on many mediums and forms. From parchment to hide
    then to paper and now to pixels. Many of these books have told great tales of brave warriors
    and horrible monsters or dystopian futures many would never come to see in their lifetimes
    and heart wrenching love stories.

    Here at Library Knihovna we believe literacy and reading are fundamental components of human
    development. As it gives you a deeper appreciation of others as it allows you to experience
    their story. Furthermore, it allows your mind to travel to faraway places you could never go.
    Or allow you brain to imagine a world that doesn’t even exist. This develops empathy,
    knowledge and imagination which have great applications in the real world when you stick your
    head out of the book your reading. However with so many books having been written how does one
    know what to read or where to even start looking for good reads.
  </p>
  <p>
   That’s why here at Library Knihovna we’ve created an enormous catalogue of books for you to browse,
    review and advise other users. So you should always have a book on your radar to read next or if you
    don’t it will never be that hard to find another good read. So keep enjoying the pleasures of reading
    and enjoy our vast catalogue of books by yourself or with others.
