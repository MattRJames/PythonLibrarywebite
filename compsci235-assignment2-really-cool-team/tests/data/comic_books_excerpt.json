He ultimately escaped the death and drugs of a crime-riddled Bronx by way of the United States Marine Corps. However, after earning his way into the esteemed ranks of the service's famed Scout Snipers, Delgado saw that old struggle reignited when he was dumped into the hell of war in Iraq.\nThere Delgado proved not only a participant, but a warrior capable of turning the tide in several of the most harrowing and historically important battles of the evolving war. He took all the hard lessons learned in combat and, as MARSOC's original lead sniper instructor, made himself a pivotal figure in revolutionizing the way special operations snipers trained and operated. But even after accomplishing his mission in the military, Delgado still faced that original fight, struggling to understand and accept the man his experiences had transformed him into.", "format": "", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35452242-bounty-hunter-4-3", "authors": [{"author_id": "16209952", "role": ""}, {"author_id": "853385", "role": ""}], "publisher": "", "num_pages": "", "publication_day": "", "isbn13": "", "publication_month": "", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2017", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35452242-bounty-hunter-4-3", "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png", "book_id": "35452242", "ratings_count": "6", "work_id": "54276229", "title": "Bounty Hunter 4/3: My Life in Combat from Marine Scout Sniper to MARSOC", "title_without_series": "Bounty Hunter 4/3: My Life in Combat from Marine Scout Sniper to MARSOC"}
